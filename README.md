# Social Network API

## Description

This challenge required me to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, I used the [Moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) package to format time, the [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) Core for testing, and the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) source-code editor.

## User Story

```
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
```

## What was my motivation?

To continue to learn and master the topics covered related to NoSQL, MongoDB, Mongoose ODM, and Express.js. I feel motivated to continue to learn and master these topics because I know that they will be important to my future as a full-stack developer.

## Why did I build this project?

To develop my skills and better understand NoSQL, MongoDB, Mongoose ODM, and Express.js. As a future full-stack developer, I will need to understand how to build and maintain a NoSQL database.

## What problem does it solve?

This application would allow a social media startup to quickly build and maintain a database of users, thoughts, and reactions.

## What did you learn?

That it takes many well maintained and defined files to organize a small db of items. How to quickly debug code and correct errors related to updated versions of dependencies.

## What makes your project stand out?

This project closely follows all defined critiera for the project and uses fun examples of thoughts and reactions to make the project more interesting.
